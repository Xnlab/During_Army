# Question
Write a program  that asks the user to enter a two-digit number, then prints the number with  
its digits reversed. A session with the program should have the following appearance:
```
Enter a two-digit number: 28  
The reversal is: 82
```
Read the number using %d, then break it into two digits. _Hint:_ If n is an integer, then n % 10  
is the last digit in n and n / 10 is n with the last digit removed.

# Code
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int i;
	printf("Enter a two-digit number: ");
	scanf("%d", &i);
	
	int x, y;
	x = i % 10;
	y = i / 10;
	
	i = x * 10 + y;
	
	printf("The reversal is: %d\n", i);
}
```
